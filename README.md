## TODO

- Clean up the project structure
- Remove unused assets (there are â€” and will be â€” a lot ðŸ˜…)
- Note: Only the required assets are loaded, even if extras are present
- When an asset is added you will need to clear the data, I want to avoid that and and the new data
- Boss collections based on boss
- Fish collection based on location
- Some items are in many loot tables, select what loot table group that should be displayed
- Loot icon weight ?
- Convert images from PNG to WEBP ?
- Improve the UI
- Search
- Filter
- PWA ?
- Improve README
- Lanague support

Note to self

- Roofing_Gadget,6,0 has the wrong sprite

## How to contribute

- To categorize an item it needs to be added to the corensponsive \_items.py lists found under ./script
- Then run script.py and it will generate the needed JSON-files that the front-end uses
