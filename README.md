All credit goes to the original creators of the sprites.

## TODO

- Clean up the project structure  
- Remove unused assets (there are â€” and will be â€” a lot ðŸ˜…)  
- Note: Only the required assets are loaded, even if extras are present
- Boss collections based on boss
- Fish collection based on location
- Search
- Filter
- PWA ?
- Improve README

## How to contribute

 - To categorize an item it needs to be added to the corensponsive _items.py lists found under ./script
 - Then run script.py and it will generate the needed JSON-files that the front-end uses
